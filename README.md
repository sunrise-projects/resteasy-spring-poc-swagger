This is "Hello world" type sample application for swagger integration with resteasy and spring. I have tried to test the integration.

You can test the application by deploying in JBoss AS 7 with http://localhost:8080/spring/person/all and http://localhost:8080/spring/api-docs

I have added short tutorial here: http://riteshkrmodi.blogspot.in/2014/01/documenting-rest-api-with-swagger-in.html
